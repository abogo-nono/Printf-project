# The current project doesnâ€™t provide a strict file structure (e.g printf, simple shell..). This means that you have the freedom to create your own file structure for this project. Feel free to organize your files in a way that makes sense to you and helps you complete the project successfullyðŸš€.

 # If this project is intended to have its own file structure, please report this as a bug on the GitHub issue with project name to fix it
